# 3Dcity-in-OpenGL

The main idea of this project is to design a 3D City using openGL. The project simulates 
the 3D art of the city. This city includes objects like buildings, houses, roads etc. These 
objects together comes to form a real like city. It includes a 3D view of the city and we 
can move through the city. This creates a virtual environment of the city and enables us 
move freely through the city helping user and architects to view in every dimention.
